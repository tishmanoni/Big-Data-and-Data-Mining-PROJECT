# Big-Data-and-Data-Mining-PROJECT

Project Background Information.
All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in the United Kingdom, along 
with (probably) a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government 
releases a large batch of data associated with these reports. This project we will be using the data 
from 2019 as it represents a very complete sample with a lot of ancillary data available. All relevant datasets can be found in the files

    (1) Brief-guide-to road-accidents-and-safety-data. This file contains a very short introduction 
    to the data set produced by the government.

    (2) variable lookup. This spreadsheet details the large amount of variables present in each of the 
    datasets. 

    (3) Road Safety Data - Accidents 2019. This spreadsheet contains the details of the accidents 
    logged in 2019.

    (4) Road Safety Data - Casualties 2019. This spreadsheet details the casualties contained in the 
    logged accidents.

    (5) Road Safety Data- Vehicles 2019. This spreadsheet contains the details of the vehicles 
    involved in the accidents. 

    (6) Adjustment Files. These files contain government modelling for the probabilities of different 
    injuries occurring for each accident.

    (i) adjustment figure guidance. This provides a short amount of government 
    guidance on the figures included. 

    (ii) cas_adjustment_lookup_2019. This spreadsheet contains the tabulated 
    adjusted probabilities of injuries.
